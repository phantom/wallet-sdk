# Phantom Wallet SDK

This monorepo contains the Phantom Wallet SDK and a demo application that demonstrates its usage.

## Overview

The Phantom Wallet SDK allows you to integrate Phantom's wallet functionality directly into your web application. It provides a simple interface for interacting with the wallet, including showing/hiding the wallet UI, performing swaps and purchases, and accessing chain-specific RPC interfaces for Solana, Ethereum, Sui, and Bitcoin.

## Packages

- **@phantom/wallet-sdk**: The core SDK that provides the Phantom wallet integration.
- **@phantom/demo-app**: A React-based demo app that demonstrates how to use the SDK.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @phantom/wallet-sdk

# Using yarn
yarn add @phantom/wallet-sdk

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @phantom/wallet-sdk
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createPhantom, Position } from "@phantom/wallet-sdk";

// Create a wallet instance
const phantom = await createPhantom({
  position: Position.bottomRight,
  hideLauncherBeforeOnboarded: false,
  namespace: "my-app",
});

// Show the wallet
phantom.show();

// Access blockchain-specific interfaces
// Solana
const solanaPublicKey = await phantom.solana.connect();
console.log("Connected Solana account:", solanaPublicKey.toString());

// Ethereum
const ethereumAccounts = await phantom.ethereum.request({
  method: "eth_requestAccounts",
});
console.log("Connected Ethereum account:", ethereumAccounts[0]);

// Use wallet functions
phantom.buy({ buy: "solana:101/nativeToken:501" }); // Buy SOL
phantom.swap({
  buy: "solana:101/address:EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
  sell: "solana:101/nativeToken:501",
}); // Swap SOL to USDC
```

### Skip Injection Mode

If you want to avoid injecting providers into the global window object, you can use the `skipInjection` option:

```typescript
// Create a wallet instance with skipInjection enabled
const phantom = await createPhantom({
  skipInjection: true,
});

// All providers are available through the phantom instance only
const solanaPublicKey = await phantom.solana.connect();
```

This is useful when you want to avoid any global namespace pollution and prefer to access all functionality through the returned Phantom instance.

## Blockchain RPC Interfaces

The SDK provides access to Phantom's blockchain-specific RPC interfaces:

- `phantom.solana` - Solana RPC interface
- `phantom.ethereum` - Ethereum, Base, Polygon and Monad Testnet RPC interface
- `phantom.sui` - Sui RPC interface
- `phantom.bitcoin` - Bitcoin RPC interface

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the demo app
yarn start:demo

# Build all packages
yarn build
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>How does the embedded wallet work with the Phantom extension?</summary>

    If the Phantom extension is detected, we will not inject the embedded wallet. Phantom users can continue using their extension like normal.

    If you want to use the embedded wallet and the Phantom extension, you need to instantiate the wallet with a custom namespace.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>What does `createPhantom()` do?</summary>

    The Phantom embedded wallet lives inside an iframe. The `createPhantom` function loads and attaches the iframe to your website.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>How do I interact with the embedded wallet?</summary>

    Once `createPhantom` has been called, `window.phantom.solana` and a compliant wallet-standard provider will also be available in the global scope of your website. This means that most of your existing code for interacting with Solana wallets should work out of the box.

    Once a user has onboarded to the embedded wallet, they should be able to click your "connect wallet" button, which gives your website access to their Solana address. After that, signing messages and transactions should just work as normal.

    If you use a namespace, you will need to invoke the functions through the `window[namespace]` object, or directly through the returned Phantom instance.

    If you use `skipInjection: true`, all providers will only be available through the returned Phantom instance.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>I can't see the embedded wallet on my website. What's wrong?</summary>

    The most common cause is that you are using a browser with the Phantom extension installed. If the Phantom extension is detected, we will not inject the embedded wallet, unless you use a custom namespace.

    You can temporarily disable the Phantom extension by going to `chrome://extensions` and toggling Phantom off.

<details>
  <summary>How much does this cost?</summary>

    It's free!
